Java code:
- ?

Arduino code:
- not synchronized with the java code
- in the loop code, you get the +PID that comes asynchronously from the client (when the client randomly sends a message)
the problem is that the chunks are received inside the sendCommand? function, so their data is lost and the music buffer is never filled
this thing should be treated separately

Some things to mention:
On chinese Arduino Megas, the RX1 and TX1 pins are printed in reverse order on the board
The 0C2A pin used for PWM manipulation in the PCM algorithm is on digital pin 11 on Uno, but pin 10 on Mega
